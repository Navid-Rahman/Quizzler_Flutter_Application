The Quizzler App is a simple quiz game built with Flutter. It presents a series of true or false questions to the user and keeps track of their score. The app utilizes the rflutter_alert package to display an alert when the quiz is completed.

# Features:
- Multiple-choice questions with true or false answers
- Instant feedback on the correctness of user's answers
- Scorekeeping using icons to display correct and incorrect answers
- Alert dialog to indicate the end of the quiz and offer a reset option

The app demonstrates the usage of stateful widgets, button styling, dynamic content rendering, and state management with the setState method.
